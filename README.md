# ipywksp

Version : v0.0.2

## Description
Add a workspace to the IPython notebook. Implemented features :
- See all the defined variables
- Sort by types/size/name
- Display variables according to their types 
- Save/load in a pickle file
- Change values of variables
- Javascript integration to have a detached workspace
- Plot variables and save the figure

## Future
- Save only visible variables in the workspace (avoid saving modules)
- Choose colums to display
- Enlarge variables (everything in a pandas dataframe?)
- Better integration of html/javascript (sort interactiv table)
- Check python 2.x/3.x compatibility

## Ideas
- Monitor system (slide for cpu and ram)
- Folder Tree for file organization + drag'd drop
- Pimp workspace : define themes, transparency... save and load preferences
